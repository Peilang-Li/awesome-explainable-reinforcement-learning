We review current explainable reinforcement learning framework and explainability of human knowledge-based reinforcement learning framework. We creatively propose a new taxonomy for existing explainable reinforcement learning based on reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we divide existing explainable reinforcement learning methods into four categories: model-explaining, reward-explaining, state-explaining, task-explaining as shown below:
